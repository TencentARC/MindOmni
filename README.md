## 📖 Abstract
Recent text-to-image systems face limitations in handling multimodal inputs and complex reasoning tasks. We introduce MindOmni, a unified multimodal large language model that addresses these challenges by incorporating reasoning generation through reinforcement learning. MindOmni leverages a three-phase training strategy: i) design of a unified vision language model with a decoder-only diffusion module, ii) supervised fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction data, and iii) our proposed Reasoning Generation Policy Optimization (RGPO) algorithm, utilizing multimodal feedback to effectively guide policy updates. Experimental results demonstrate that MindOmni outperforms existing models, achieving impressive performance on both understanding and generation benchmarks, meanwhile showcasing advanced fine-grained reasoning generation capabilities, especially with mathematical reasoning instruction.

---

We visualize and compare advanced text-to-image methods and unified systems on the
reasoning generation task, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5. In the absence of a reasoning mode, GPT-4o is unable to perform reasoning generation for scenarios involving mathematical logic and physical perception.
